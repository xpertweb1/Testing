<h4>Why I develop this bbPress plugin:</h4>
bbPress is a great forum product, I used it build many forums, but in recent days when I build a site which focus the forum, I found a problem:  there are no bbpress login link, bbpress register link, bbpress forget password links in bbpress forum index pages or bbpress single forum pages or bbpress forum pages or bbpress topic pages. 

I try to find a solution, the result is I understand in the current time, I had to put the forum login link at the widget or I had to tell users to how to find the log in link in forum topics or add register/login links in the menu items...
 
For webmasters, the widget is rare asset and the sidebar area have no so many place to put a big log in widget..., for users, many of users/clients is not good at forum scripts or web sites, and they have no time to find the log in link in your sites..., the result is many of users just leave away from your forums, as a webmaster, this is not good because you used so many days/nights to build the site and offer the services. 

I think the most easy way is put the log in/register links in the forum pages or in the topic pages, for this reason, I developed a new bbpress plugin: bbPress Login Register Links On Forum Page And Topic. 

Many users requested a dedicated bbPress sidebar, because in the current time, bbPress be designed to using wordpress sidebar, no bbpress sidebar, but in bbPress forums, there are a few things only releated with forum users, for example, recent topics, bbPress logged users... and so on, these things is important for bbPress users, but it is not helpful for users on wordpress side, so it is better to add a dedicated bbPress only sidebar. 
This plugin works like this way:
When users view wordpress pages(not in bbPress forums), nothing changed.
When users view bbPress forums / bbPress pages, the plugin will detect all sidebars in your theme, 
and replace the first sidebar as a dedicated bbPess sidebar automatically, no any code needed. 
In admin area, you will find a new "bbPress Sidebar", you can just drag your widgets to this bbPress Sidebar, and these widgets will shown only in bbPress pages.   
In our plugin "bbPress Login Global Settings" Panel, you can enable / disable bbPress only sidebar, and select an existed sidebar as bbpress sidebar  

<h4>How To Use:</h4>
It is very easy to install and use: 

1: Please just upload the plugin and active it

2: It will works well automatically, I have added default css codes in the plugin, and you can custom your codes in back end.  

3: You will find at the top of forum pages, there are log in / register and Lost / Password links,  when a user is logged in, the login link will turn into logout link. 
Also if you use some log in plugins like theme my login which changed login/register links, the plugin will still works well, how it looks? Please check screenshots. :)

4: If you need custom style of any link for a better UI in your theme, you can go to the plugin setting panel "bbPress Custom", you can do it very easy. 
Also in here, actually you can custom any style css codes for your bbPress or WordPress site.
    
5: If you click "Global Settings", you will find options to "Login redirected to the same topic page from where clicked the login link" and "Enable bbPress only sidebar to allow admin to add widgets for bbPress topics and replies", and you can select an existed sidebar as bbpress sidebar
