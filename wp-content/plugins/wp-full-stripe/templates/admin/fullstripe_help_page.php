<h2><?php esc_html_e( 'WP Full Stripe Help' . ' (v' . MM_WPFS::VERSION . ')', 'wp-full-stripe-admin' ); ?></h2>
<p>This plugin is designed to make it easy for you to accept payments and create subscriptions from your Wordpress
	site. Powered by Stripe, you can embed payment forms into any post or page and take payments directly from your
	website without making your customers leave for a 3rd party website.</p>
<h4>Setup</h4>
<ol>
	<li>You need a free Stripe account from <a target="_blank" href="https://stripe.com">Stripe.com</a></li>
	<li>Get your Stripe API keys from your
		<a href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/apikeys" target="_blank">Stripe Dashboard -> API</a> page
	</li>
	<li>Update Full Stripe settings with your API keys and select an API mode.<br/>(Test mode is recommended
		initially to make sure everything is set up correctly)
	</li>
	<li>Get your plugin's webhook URL on the Full Stripe settings page.</li>
	<li>Set the webhook URL on the <a target="_blank" href="https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks">Stripe
			Dashboard ->
			Webhooks -> Settings</a> page.<br/>
		Add endpoints for live and test mode, and make sure that Stripe sends all events ("Send me all events" option).
	</li>
</ol>


<h4>Introduction to forms: inline forms and checkout forms</h4>
<p>Now that the Stripe keys are set, you can create payment forms and subscription forms as well.<br/><br/>
	Forms are available in two flavors: inline and checkout:<br/>
<ul>
	<li>Inline forms are standard HTML forms, all fields rendered as part of your page.</li>
	<li>Checkout forms take advantage of <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/checkout">Stripe Checkout</a>
		functionality which will give you the option to place a button on any post or page. <br/>
		The button will trigger loading of a pre-styled form with built in validation hosted by Stripe. The styling and
		functionality of
		the form is all controlled by Stripe and offers a fast and easy way to get started.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h4>One-time payments</h4>
<p>You can create one-time payment forms on the "Full Stripe -> Payments -> Payment Forms" page.<br/>
	A payment form is set up to take a specific payment amount from your customers. Create the form by setting it's
	name, title
	and payment amount.
	You can also choose to allow your customers to enter custom amounts on the form, or to select the amount from a
	list. This makes creating things like donation forms easier.
	The form name is used in the shortcode (see below) to display the form.</p>
<p>To show an inline payment form, add the following shortcode to any post or page:
	<code>[fullstripe_form name="formName" type="inline_payment"]</code> where "formName" equals the name you used to
	create the form.
</p>
<p>To show a checkout payment form, add the following shortcode to any post or page:
	<code>[fullstripe_form name="formName" type="popup_payment"]</code> where "formName" equals the name you used to
	create the form.
</p>

<p>Once a payment is taken using the form, the payment information will appear on the "Full Stripe -> Payments ->
	Payments" page as
	well as on your Stripe Dashboard.</p>

<h4>Subscriptions</h4>
<p>Similar to one-time payments, you can sign customers up for recurring subscriptions using a subscription form. Before
	creating a subscription form, you will need to create a subscription plan. You can do this from the "Full Stripe ->
	Subscriptions ->
	Subscription Plans" page.
</p>
<p>When creating a subscription form, you choose the name, title and the plans that you wish to offer your
	customers.</p>
<p>To show an inline subscription form, add the following shortcode to any post or page:
	<code>[fullstripe_form name="formName" type="inline_subscription"]</code> where "formName" equals the name you used
	to create the
	form.
</p>
<p>To show a checkout subscription form, add the following shortcode to any post or page:
	<code>[fullstripe_form name="formName" type="popup_subscription"]</code> where "formName" equals the name you used
	to create
	the
	form.
</p>

<p>You can view your list of subscribers on the "Full Stripe -> Subscriptions -> Subscribers" page or directly
	on the
	<a href="https://manage.stripe.com">Stripe Dashboard</a></p>
<p>You can also cancel subscriptions on the "Subscribers" page.<br/>
	(Note: Cancelling subscriptions works only for subscriptions created with the v3.6+ versions of the plugin)
</p>
<h4>Subscriptions ending automatically - Payments in installments</h4>
<p>You can create subscriptions ending automatically after a certain number of charges.<br/>As an example, your
	customers could pay for your consulting or courses in installments.</p>
<p>In order to do this, create a subscription plan with the "Payment cancellation count" option set to the number of
	charges after which the subscription should end, and use this plan on the subscription form.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: Make sure that webhooks are set up properly, otherwise this functionality will not work.</p>
<h4>Collecting VAT on subscriptions</h4>
<p>You can add VAT to subscription charges.<br/>
	VAT is added to both the recurring fee and the setup fee.
</p>
<p>
	You can set the VAT rate on the "Finance" tab of the subscription form.<br/>
	The VAT rate calculation strategy can be:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>No VAT - No VAT is added, the "tax_percent" Stripe property is not set.</li>
	<li>Fixed rate - A fixed percentage of the net amount is added as VAT, the "tax_percent" Stripe property is set
		accordingly.
	</li>
	<li>Custom rate - You can provide your own code to determine the VAT rate based on form data. It can be
		implemented as Wordpress filter.<br/>
		For more information, please refer to the "For developers" section of our knowledge base at
		<a target="_blank" href="<?php echo $knowledgeBaseUrl; ?>">https://paymentsplugin.com/knowledge-base/</a> .
	</li>
</ol>
<h4>Saving credit card data without charging the customer</h4>
<p>
	It's possible to save the customer's credit card for later use, without charging the customer immediately.<br/><br/>
	You can do this by creating a save card form. This form creates
	a Stripe customer object which may contain not just the card data but billing address, shipping address, and also
	custom fields.<br/><br/>
	The saved cards are listed on the "Full Stripe -> Saved Cards -> Saved Cards" page in WP admin.
</p>

<h4>Manage subscriptions page</h4>
<p>You can set up a protected page where subscribers can manage their subscriptions.<br/>
	This page lets subscribers update the credit card used for their subscriptions, and also cancel subscriptions.</p>
<p>Use the <code>[fullstripe_manage_subscriptions]</code> shortcode on the page where you'd like the "Manage
	subscription" pane to appear.</p>
<p>The user journey is as follows:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Subscriber has to enter the email address used for her subscription(s)</li>
	<li>An email is sent with a security code to the subscriber's email address</li>
	<li>Subscriber enters security code and is logged in to the "Manage subscription" page</li>
</ol>

<p>Important: You should protect your subscribers by enabling Google reCaptcha for the "Manage subscription" page.<br/>
	<br/>
	Follow these steps to turn on Google reCaptcha:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Register your site for Google ReCaptcha, and get API keys.<br/>
		Find out more in our <a target="_blank" href="<?php echo $knowledgeBaseUrl; ?>">Knowledge base</a>
	</li>
	<li>Enable Google reCaptcha on the "Full Stripe -> Settings -> User" page in WP admin, and enter your Google
		reCaptcha API keys.
	</li>
</ol>


<h4>SSL</h4>
<p>Use of SSL is
	<strong>highly recommended</strong> as this will protect your customers' data. No card details are ever
	stored on your server. However, without SSL they are still subject to certain types of hacking. SSL certificates
	are extremely affordable from companies like
	<a href="http://www.namecheap.com">Namecheap</a> and well worth it for the security of your customers.
</p>
<h4>Payment Currency</h4>
<p>The currencies Stripe supports depend on where your business is located. If you select a country/currency
	combination that Stripe does not support then the payment will fail.</p>
<p>Please refer to the
	<a target="_blank" href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/which-currencies-does-stripe-support">Stripe
		documentation</a> for more details.
</p>

<h4>Custom Fields</h4>
<p>You can collect extra pieces of information from your customer, and store them in custom fields.
	When creating a form, you can choose to create 10 custom form fields.
	The custom fields will be appended to the payment information and viewable in your Stripe dashboard once the
	payment is complete.</p>

<h4>Coupons</h4>
<p>You can accept coupon codes with subscriptions. First you must create the coupon in your Stripe dashboard. When
	creating your subscription forms you can turn on the option to allow a coupon code, and if the customer
	adds the correct code this will be applied to their payment(s).</p>
<a name="receipt-tokens"></a>

<h4>Email Receipts</h4>
<p>All payment forms can send customized email notifications.<br/>
	Payment forms can send a payment receipt.<br/>
	Subscription forms can send a subscription receipt, and a notification when a subscription has ended.<br>
	<br/>
	You have some placeholder tokens that can be placed in the email HTML,
	and WP Full Stripe will substitute the relevant values. The tokens that can be used are: </p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>%AMOUNT%</strong> - Gross payment amount. On one-time payment forms, it's the payment amount. On

<a name="thank-you-page-tokens"></a>
<h4>Redirects and confirmation ("Thank you") pages</h4>
<p>After a successful payment, the plugin can redirect to any page, post, or external URL known as the confirmation
	("Thank you") page.</p>
<p>
	You can enable redirects on a form by:
<ol>
	<li>Setting the "Redirect on Success?" option to "Yes"; and</li>
	<li>Setting the page or post in the "Redirect to" option.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
	You can use placeholder tokens on "Thank you" pages, similar to email receipts.<br/>
	It can be turned on by checking the "Enable placeholder tokens on Thank You pages?" option of the form.<br/>
	<br/>
	When placeholder tokens are allowed on a Thank you page, then payment-related information can be displayed only
	once, after having redirected from the payment page.
</p>

<p>Use the following shortcodes on a Thank you page to display payment-related information:</p>
<p>
<pre>
        [fullstripe_thankyou]
        [fullstripe_thankyou_success]
		Thank you for your purchase, %CUSTOMERNAME%!
        [/fullstripe_thankyou_success]
        [fullstripe_thankyou_default]
		No payment data available
        [/fullstripe_thankyou_default]
        [/fullstripe_thankyou]
        </pre>
</p>
<p>
	You can use the <code>[fullstripe_thankyou]</code> shortcode to mark the area where you'd like the payment
	information
	to be displayed.<br/>
	<br/>
	Inside <code>[fullstripe_thankyou]</code>, use the <code>[fullstripe_thankyou_success]</code> shortcode to display
	payment-related data (see the <a href="#receipt-tokens">Email Receipts</a> section for the placeholder tokens),
	and use <code>[fullstripe_thankyou_default]</code> to display feedback to the user when the Thank you page has been
	called directly.
</p>
<h4>How to translate the plugin</h4>
<p>You can translate the public labels of the plugin by following these steps:
<ol>
	<li>
		Copy the "wp-content/plugins/wp-full-stripe/languages/wp-full-stripe.pot" file to
		"wp-content/plugins/wp-full-stripe/languages/wp-full-stripe-&lt;language code&gt;_&lt;country code&gt;.po"
		file<br/>
		where &lt;language code&gt; is the two-letter ISO language code and &lt;country code&gt; is the two-letter
		ISO country code.<br/>
		Please refer to
		<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html#Locale-Names" target="_blank">Locale
			names</a> section of the <code>gettext</code> utility manual for more information.
	</li>
	<li>
		Edit the "wp-content/plugins/wp-full-stripe/languages/wp-full-stripe-&lt;language code&gt;_&lt;country code&gt;.po"
		file and add your translations to it.
	</li>
	<li>
		Use the <a href="http://po2mo.net" target="_blank">http://po2mo.net</a> website or a similar service to convert
		your .po file to an .mo file.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you don't want to upload your .po file to a second party, then run the <code>msgfmt</code> utility (part of
		the gettext distribution) to convert the .po file to an .mo
		file, for example:<br/><br/>
		<code>msgfmt -cv -o \<br/>
			wp-content/plugins/wp-full-stripe/languages/wp-full-stripe-de_DE.mo \<br/>
			wp-content/plugins/wp-full-stripe/languages/wp-full-stripe-de_DE.po
		</code>
	</li>
	<li>
		Make sure that the newly created .mo file is in the "wp-content/plugins/wp-full-stripe/languages" folder and
		its name conforms to "wp-full-stripe-&lt;language code&gt;_&lt;country code&gt;.po".
	</li>
</ol>
